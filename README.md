# CityFacts (a sample Alexa Skill)

This is a fairly simple example of an Alexa Skill that will respond to a user with random facts about cities. This is the example code associated with the Alexa tutorial found [here](https://billsykes.net/2017/04/07/developing-an-amazon-alexa-skill-part-1/). The tutorial is broken into three sections. If you want to see the code associated with a particular section then you will need to check out the corresponding branch. For example, to view the code associated with the first section:

```
git checkout part1
```
